# Cryptanalysis-of-Vigen-re-cipher
## This type of cipher begins with the priming key of length n, Encryption for the first n characters is done the same way (using the key) as for the simple shift vigenere, but after that, to encipher the ith character of the plaintext, we add to it the (i-n)th letter of the plaintext. And an auto key vigenere. 

#### I made cryptanalysis with the famous two steps first find the length of key and second find the key Using C++. 
I used to find the length of key The index of coincidence that depend on make all substrings of all possible length from ciphertext and calculate The index of coincidence for all keys length and get all average for each group of key length and the maximum will be correct length and the take this length and get all substrings from ciphertext by left number characters as the length of key and calculate Chi-squared for every substring and get the minimum Chi-squared and second minimum and get the number of index of it that is the number corresponding to the character of English from A to Z and get all possible keys from these two keys if they are the same get plaintext of ciphertext and print key and plaintext this process will take less than 10 seconds if the two keys not equal the program will get all possible keys from two keys into vector and after that remove duplicates from vector and making the Quadgram test to all plaintext that will produced from all unique keys to test the fitness on english of each plaintext so the program will take 10 min to load the file that contains all Quadgram of EnglishLanguage and after that will calculate the Quadgram of each plaintext and the maximum number of Quadgram means it is more likely to be English and will print key and plaintext.
### Note That (the File that has all Quadgram Of English is named file.txt)
